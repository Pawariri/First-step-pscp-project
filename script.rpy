    stab me!” when Amamura sees her face he saw she looking at him with disdainful blue eyes

    the answer” or just random answer in the choice."

    "Ayako sees Amamura acting like a child she chuckles and said “CUTE” in a soft tone while
    smiling."

    ama "What did you just say?!"

    ame "I just say you are an Idiot"

    "In his mind, he screams “LIARRRRR”."

    "Amamura understood Russian because of her paternal grandfather, who was
    a great lover of Russia."

    "It all started around the elementary school when he was under the care of his
    grandfather’s house for a time and his grandfather made him watch a lot of
    Russian films."

    "Amamura himself had never been to Russia, nor did he have any relatives
    who were Russian."

    "He never mentioned it at school, so the only person at this school who knew
    that Amamura understood Russian was his little sister in the neighboring
    class."

    "And he forbade his little sister to talk about it too, so there’s no one else who
    knew."

    "At this point in time, he thought he should’ve come out to her earlier, but it was
    too late to regret it."

    "This mysterious shameful play in which a beautiful girl in the neighboring
    seat who was sweet only in Russian, too; everything was a seed that he had
    sown, so he had to accept it."

    "He could feel the indescribable embarrassment welling up in his chest, his
    face reddening. He was trying his best to hold his breath while pursing his lips tightly.\nThereupon, Ayako who mistakenly believed that he was holding in
    his anger, muttered in amusement from the bottom of her heart."

    ame "“I LIKE WHEN YOU ACT LIKE A CHILD, CUTE”"

    "Amamura’s mind conjured up images of himself transforming into a young
    child, poked at the cheeks by Ayako with a smirk on her face."

    ama "I see, you want war. huh!!"

    "Amamura understood he was completely being looked upon and played
    with, and his face became serious at once."

    ama "Fourteen minutes left. Ten minutes left."
    
    "During that time, I’ll try to fight back. Then he realizes he forget some things."

    ama "Damn it! I didn’t roll the free gacha in the morning!!"

    "Normally, he would have rolled it before he left home or
    before homeroom, but he was so sleepy this morning that he wasn’t thinking
    to that extent."

    "Because his thought has completely shifted to the otaku side, he no longer
    cared about the fact that Ayako treated him like a baby. It couldn’t be helped to
    have the feeling that his simple mind was called as on the same level like that
    of a child’s, too."
    "Though, the person in question wasn’t self-aware of it.
    The teacher properly performed his duty for the remainder of the lesson and
    left the classroom. As soon as he saw the teacher leave, bringing his desk back
    to its original position he quickly took out his phone and launched the game
    app as fast as he could."

    "Ayako who found fault at that knitted her brows and gave him a warning."

    ame "It’s against school regulations to use your phone within school except in
    emergencies and when used for study. You have the nerve to use your phone
    in front of me, a student council member."

    ama "Then, it’s not a violation of school regulations, right? It’s an emergency after
    all."

    ame "I’ll listen just in case, what’s the emergency ?"

    "Under Ayako’s scornful eyes, which like it’s saying, probably for the wrong
    reasons, anyway, Amamura said with an unnecessarily crisp face."

    ama "“Free gacha. Ten minutes left until it ends."

    ame "Do you want me to confiscate your phone ?"

    ama "I believe you wouldn’t do something like that EHE☆."

    ame "“Maybe I really should confiscate your phone for once."

    ama "Now I’ve noticed, I haven’t
    done a wink or anything like that in a long time. It surprisingly has a high
    degree of difficulty, huh ? *Wink*."

    ame "What are you saying all of sudden..."

    ama "“I mean, idols, like, do it sometimes, but there are not many celebrities who
    can wink beautifully, isn’t there."

    ame "“Do you think so ?"

    ama "Eh? Isn’t it difficult? Doesn’t it make your cheeks and the edges of your
    mouth twitch in a weird way no matter what, making it feel more like ‘mmm’ than a ‘snap’ ?"

    ame "It doesn’t, you know."

    ama "Ooh? Then how about you show it, a really beautiful wink."

    "Amamura raised his head and smiled challengingly. With a sour look,
    Ayako’s eyebrows twitched and the classmates in the surrounding who were
    listening to the conversation lightly buzzed."

    "In a moment all of the attention from the surrounding were on her; she faced
    Amamura with a disappointed look on her face and let out a big sigh once."

    ame "Haah... Look, like this, right?"

    "And then, while tilting her head she did an extremely brilliant wink.
    Without applying any extra force to the rest of the face, her eye closed
    naturally with a snap."

    "In the precious scene of the aloof princess winking, “Ooohh!!”, the
    surrounding raised the sounds of commotion and cheers, and there was even
    sparse applause."

    "But, as for, Amamura the one who made the request...."

    ama "Yeaaah! SSR Tsukuyomi came!! ....huh, aah sorry. I wasn’t looking for a second."

    ame "Confiscated."

    ama "No!"

    "Amamura screamed as his phone was mercilessly taken away.\n
    At that, Ayako looked down on him with a daunting pose."

    "Whether out of anger or even shame, her face reddened slightly,
    And there, Aykao’s ears picked up the voices of three male students facing each
    other conversing in a whisper."

    "Male Classmate A" "He-hey, did you get that?"
    "Male Classmate B" "No, the angle is a little...."
    "Male Classmate C" "Fuuh, leave it to me. I got that wink moment down perfectly."
    "Male Classmate B" "Give me that picture! I’ll even give you up a thousand yen!"

    ame "Confiscated."

    "Male Classmate A-C" "Geh!? Ame-san!?"
    "Male Classmate A" "Ame-san! We’re not doing any-"

    "They tried to play dumb but they instantly shrunk back at the gaze that was
    directed at them."
    "However, it’s understandable. In fact, The figure of Ayako raising her chin and
    looking down at them in the argument was so powerful that even a big man
    would have flinched."
    "Her cold, hard gaze was exactly tundra-class."
    "As if a blizzard was blowing powerfully behind them, the other classmates
    who had been excited by Ayako’s wink all looked away quickly and held their
    breath so the aftermath wouldn’t reach them."
    "The classmates waited for the blizzard to pass, face down. However, there
    was about one boy who wasn’t at all afraid of her imposing appearance."

    ama "Please forgive mee~ Have mercy~"

    "Furthermore, he even defended himself. While words such as, “Is this guy for
    real”, came from the surroundings and their gazes gathered at Amamura."
    "Ayako kept her tundra-like expression and looked down at the phone she had
    taken away from Amamura."

    ame "Tsukiyomi? Tsukiyomi is the goddess of the moon in Japanese
    mythology, right? Why is her hair not black but silver ?"

    ama "Eh... who knows? Isn’t it because of the image of the moon? Well, she’s cute
    so don’t bother with tiny details."

    ame "...Hmph!"

    "As Amamura took the phone in both hands and worshipped her, Ayako snorted, not even
    trying to hide her displeasure. The other three phones were
    also returned to their owners."
    "After she made sure that the photographs taken sneakily were deleted, she sat
    down at her seat roughly."
    
    ama "Uwaah~ It’s seriously Tsukiyomi-sama. I thought I will never get her."

    "Wrapping her own hair around her finger and playing with it, Ayako glanced
    at Amamura who was looking at the screen of his phone with sparkling eyes,
    and pouted her lips."

    ame "(I also have silver hair aswell you know ?)"

    "Amamura froze at the surprise jealousy attack that came flying suddenly."

    ama "....What did you say ?"

    "He naturally didn’t fail to hear it and Amamura raised his head with his face
    twitching. She glanced at him with a cold gaze, stopped playing with her hair
    and said as if to spit out."

    ame "I just said ‘GAME ADDICT'."
    ama " “Hey! it’s rude to talk like that."

    "Ayako flinched a little when Amamura raised his voice with a rugged voice
    donning an unusually serious expression. But immediately she said, “I’m not
    saying anything wrong”, and strongly glared back at him."
    "Amamura cautioned her with a deadly serious expression, and the overflowing tension
    around them, once again, the eyes of the surrounding gathered at them."

    ama "Don’t you think it’s rude to the true addicts who play 20 hours a day, to call
    me, who play 8 hours a day, a game addict ?"

    "As if she was looking at trash, Ayako’s gaze pierced Amamura, who said
    something stupid with a uselessly crisp face. As if it physically pierced him."
    "Amamura let out a “Guhaa” and held down his chest."
    "Ayako just couldn’t deal with Amamura’s theatrical demeanor that had no
    bounds anymore and sighed grandly."
    
    ame "Good grief.... You look unusually serious, so I thought you going to speak something
    seriously."
    ama "Hey, that’s absurd. I’m always serious at any time, you know? It’s no
    exaggeration to say that seriousness is my good point."
    ame "It’s the biggest exaggeration of the century."
    ama "There’s still 80 percent left in this century though?!"
    ame "Haah... Enough already and put your phone away."

    "As he was about to put his phone away and decided to leave it at that.... Immediately, he
    stopped moving at the Russian words that reached his ears."

    ame "If you were serious you’d look cool, and I will fall for you for sure."

    "He spontaneously turned around at the murmur that really made his spine
    tingle."

    ama "What did you say ?"
    ame "I said, ‘I lost hope'"
    ama "...Aah that so."
    ame "Yes, that’s right"
    
    "Not leaving his mouth, Amamura screamed his inner thoughts loudly,
    “Liiiiaaaaaaarr!!”, and He read Ayako face expression: “I~diot. Humph”. Accurately
    understanding."
    "what she really thought, Amamura ’s face was twitching."

    ama "(I. Totally. Understand. What are you saying you know ?!!!)"
    
    "How refreshing it would be if he could shout it out as loud as he could. But,
    the only one who would lose out by revealing it would be him."

    ama "AHHH!!!"

    "Amamura knew he couldn’t reveal it but, he just felt pent-up. One way or another he
    wanted to reveal the nose of this hidden tsundere-girl."
    "He was grinding his teeth, but at that moment, suddenly the door in front of the classroom was
    opened."

    "Teacher" "‘Allo~, it’s a little early but the lesson will start okay~ .... Huh, Amamura. Why are
    you taking out your phone."
    ama "AH!!"

    "Being pointed out by the teacher who came in, Amamura realized after all
    this time that he was still holding his phone."

    ama "Well, just a little research for an assignment."
    "Teacher" "Is that true, Ame?"
    ame "No, Amamura-Kun was playing a game on his phone."
    ama "Hey?!"
    "Teacher" "I knew it. Come here, Amamura! It’s confiscated!"
    ama "No, what do you mean you knew it!"
    
    "Amamura protested to the teacher as he reluctantly went to the teacher’s
    platform. As she watched his back, Ayako shrugged her shoulders."

    ame "Haah... He’s really an idiot."

    "She muttered in a completely dumbfounded tone but, contrary to her tone, her
    lips slightly smiling. However, her classmates, except Amamura, didn’t notice this."

    ama "ANYA! you little-"

    "Amamura return to his seat and talk to Ayako quietly."

    ama "You seem to be happy, huh."
    ame "Well isn’t it true that you use your phone to play game not searching something
    useful."
    ama "I can’t argue with that…"

    "Amamura want to tease Ayako back but he has no idea how to tease her back."

    sora "Uuuh, this one is the one that comes later."

    "Intrigued, both of them reached out their chopsticks and took a bite of the
    noodles but, they instantly frowned and reached their hands to their cup. To
    such two people, Amamura said as if to admonish them."

    ama "Hey, you can’t call something spicy if the steam doesn’t sting your eyes,
    right ?"
    yoru "In the first place, I can’t even slurp up really spicy ramen because it hurts
    my lips."
    sora "It hurts your stomach too right?"

    "The entrance of the cafeteria became noisy."
    "Amamura and the others reflexively turned their eyes in that direction and
    three girls were just entering the cafeteria."
    "It’s a little like an idol appearance but, in fact, those three girls were all far
    better looking than most idols out there."

    yoru "Really, they’re truly beautiful sisters, aren’t they? Ame sisters”
    That’s right, the girl in front of Ayako was a second-year and student
    council secretary, and her name was Ayame Ame. Her
    nickname was Masha and her a-year-older biological elder sister."

    "Her shoulder-length, wavy hair was light brown. Her gentle-looking slightly
    drooping eyes were also light brown. Her face too In contrast to Ayako, was a
    childlike face that was far more Japanese looking."
    "Her voluptuous body, the combination of her gentle-looking appearance and
    soft atmosphere; she radiated a motherly quality that was hard to believe for a
    second-year high school student."

    sora "Hmmm!! I almost forget that I need to go to my club room."
    yoru "I have business with my music band too."
    ama "So you guys gonna leave from me, I am sad you know."

    "Amamura speaks like a princess who feels lonely."
    
    sora "Please don’t speak with princess tone of voice."
    yoru "I am sorry Amamura it is an important one."
    ama "Just kidding just go, I can eat alone."
    sora "Yoru, let's go."
    yoru "See you at the classroom Amamura."
    ama "Guess I should finish eating this quickly."

    "Amamura met his eye with his friend in another classroom who is a student council member.
    she looks around the surrounding."
    "She sees Amamura table have an available seat."

    ama "Ah… Don’t come here."

    'Her call out to Ayako and walked straight towards Amamura direction.'

    "???" "Hachi-kun,  May I have a seat ?"

    "She was a first-year who served as the student council public relation, and her
    name was Suou Yuka."
    "She had long, lustrous waist-length black hair and in spite of her small build,her body was
    well-proportioned, asserting femininity properly."
    "her appearance was very well-groomed, with a hint of elegance in her cuteness. Even from
    a distance, you could see the girl’s good upbringing from her straight posture and her
    graceful conduct."
    "The moment Yuka said that Ayako, who was following behind her, had a
    wrinkle between her eyebrows."

    ama "Yes, you can have a seat."

    "She thanked Amamura with a beautiful smile on her face. Yuki then
    walked around the table and sat down next to Amamura. Ayako also sat down diagonally
    right ahead of Amamura."

    yuka "Aah, as expected, Amamura-Kun ordered the same thing too, didn’t he ?"

    "Exactly as she said, on Yuka’s tray was a bowl of mapo ramen, the same as
    Amamura."

    yuka "It’s delicious, isn’t it. I think it could be a little spicier, though."
    ama "I know, right. I need to add more chili oil."
    yuka "Although we have salt and soy sauce here, there is no chili oil, isn’t it.
    Maybe we could consider it for the next student council agenda."
    ama "Hey, you’re mixing public and private affairs."

    "Yuka let out a giggle at Amamura’s retort while saying, “It’s just a joke”.At the two people’s
    friendly conversation, Ayako who was eating set meal A had a second wrinkle appear
    between her eyes. As before, Amamura and Yuka didn’t notice it."
    "While the area between her eyebrows wrinkled more and more at this, Ayako’s
    closed her eyes and corrected her expression, and asked in a casual tone."

    ame "I wonder if you two are close ?"
    
    "To Ayako’s question, Yuka faced forward and answered while smiling pleasantly."

    yuka "We are childhood friends."
    ame "Childhood friends ?"
    yuka "Yes, We have been at the same school since kindergarten, you know?
    Unfortunately, we have never been in the same class before, though."
    ame "I see."

    "Ayako nodded really half-heartedly as if she was convinced and not
    convinced at the same time. This time, Amamura asked a question."

    ama "Do you two get along like that ?"
    yuka "We are in the middle of trying to get along, I think? At least, I would like to
    be friends with Ayako-san, however."

    "At Yuka’s direct words, Ayako’s eyes opened wide and her eyes wandered
    about as if in a little bit of trouble."

    ame "....I don’t think it’d be enjoyable being friends with me."
    yuka "In other words, Ayako-san doesn’t mind being friends with me, do you ?"
    ame "Eh.... I guess, so ?"
    yuka "Then, let’s be friends! We are in the same student council and in the same
    first year after all. Aah, that’s right! If you don’t mind, is it fine for me to call
    you Anya-san ?"
    yuka "I heard Masha-senpai and Hachi-kun are you calling you
    that, and I was thinking it was a lovely way of calling you."
    ame "Ye-yes.... That’s fine, I think."
    yuka "Fufuu, I am glad. Once again, I am looking forward to getting along with
    you, okay? Anya-san. And me too, please call me Yuka."
    ame "Yes.... likewise, Yuka-san."
